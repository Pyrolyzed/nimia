# Nimia

Nimia is a Minecraft 1.16.5 modpack with an emphasis on being huge.

However, this doesn't mean we just add uneccesary mods just to bloat the mod count. We make sure no mod is redundant, overpowered, or low-quality. 
We also strive to provide a well-performing pack, although it still requires above-average hardware to run.
